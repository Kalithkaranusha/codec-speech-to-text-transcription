# codec-speech-to-text-transcription
This tool converts spoken words from an audio file into written text using Python's SpeechRecognition library. It loads an audio recording (preferably in WAV format), processes it, and uses Google's Speech Recognition API to transcribe the speech into text. It's useful for automating note-taking, generating subtitles, or processing voice input.
